# -- ccontainer amalgamete helper script --
# This helper script iterates include/ccontainer directory
# Copies all header files
# And creates one single .h file which named `ccontainer_amalgamate.h` out of it
# Into the curret directory or specified directory
# By this way you can use all the container types without 
# explicity including them.
